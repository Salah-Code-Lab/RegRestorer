# üî¨ MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

## Detection Analysis Confirms Effectiveness

Our tool triggers **enterprise EDR platforms** because we perform the **exact same registry modifications** as advanced threats - but in reverse to **repair systems**.

### MITRE Techniques Triggered:
- **T1547.004** - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Winlogon Helper DLL
- **T1112** - Modify Registry  
- **T1543.003** - Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service
- **T1562.001** - Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools
- **T1548.002** - Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Bypass User Account Control
